# Understand.me - Developer's Guide

Welcome to the "Understand.me" Developer's Guide. This guide is specifically for software engineers, architects, and technical leads involved in the hands-on development and maintenance of the "Understand.me" mobile application and its associated backend systems.

It focuses on the technical architecture, implementation details, development processes, and operational considerations for building "Understand.me" using its serverless-focused technology stack, which includes Expo (React Native), Supabase, PicaOS (AI Orchestration), Google GenAI, ElevenLabs, Dappier, Nodely, and Sentry.

This Developer's Guide complements the separate **UI Development Guide** (located in the `../development_guide` directory), which details the UI/UX principles, screen-by-screen breakdowns, shared UI components, and Alex's persona from a user interface perspective. Developers should refer to both guides for a complete understanding of the application.
