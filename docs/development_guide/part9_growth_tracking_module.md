# Part 9: Growth & Tracking Module

This part of the Development Guide details the "Understand-me" Growth & Tracking Module for the **Expo (React Native) mobile application**. It focuses on personalized insights, progress tracking, and learning resources. UI styling uses **React Native StyleSheet API** (or NativeWind) and navigation is via **React Navigation**, likely within a dedicated "Growth" tab on the main Bottom Tab Navigator. PicaOS might be involved in orchestrating complex AI insight generation flows, while Dappier could source sensitive user data for insights if stored in a decentralized manner. Nodely would manage storage/retrieval of user progress data and learning material metadata from Supabase.

## 9.1. Screen: Personal Growth Insights (Mermaid: CB, K, CF, CG)

*   **Mermaid Diagram ID:** K (Personal Growth Dashboard - main screen of the "Growth" tab), CB (Overview/Summary card/section), CF (Communication Pattern detail screen/section), CG (Emotional Regulation detail screen/section).

*   **Purpose:** (Remains the same)

*   **Key UI Elements (within Growth Dashboard - K, using React Native components):**
    *   **Main Container (`<ScrollView>`):**
    *   **View CB: Insights Overview / Dashboard Summary (`<View>` card):**
        *   Personalized greeting from Alex (`<Text>` - Component 10.2).
        *   "Key Highlight" Card (`<View>` with `<Text>`).
        *   Summary widgets (`<TouchableOpacity>` cards) for Communication Patterns, Emotional Regulation, linking to CF, CG.
        *   Trend lines (`react-native-svg-charts`).
        *   Date range selectors (`<TouchableOpacity>` buttons or a date picker modal - Component 10.7).
    *   **View CF: Communication Pattern Insights (Detail screen via Stack Navigation, or collapsible `<View>` section):**
        *   Specific Metric Sections (`<View>` for each, e.g., Clarity, Filler Words):
            *   Metric score/level (`<Text>`). Trend graph (`react-native-svg-charts`).
            *   Comparison to goals (`<Text>`). Examples (`<Text>` with links to transcript moments - potentially opening a Modal with relevant transcript part). Actionable tips (`<Text>`).
    *   **View CG: Emotional Regulation & Expression Insights (Detail screen or collapsible `<View>` section):**
        *   Sentiment Trend Analysis (`react-native-svg-charts`).
        *   Emotional Word Cloud (could be a custom `<View>` rendering styled `<Text>` components, or an `<Image>` generated by AI).
        *   Reflection Prompts (`<Text>`). Progress on Goals (`<Text>`). Tips (`<Text>`).

*   **Voice Agent Interactions (Alex - Component 10.2):** (Scripts remain largely the same, delivered via Alex's standard presence in AI Panel or specific coaching cards)
    *   Alex explains insights displayed in `<Text>` and chart components.
    *   PicaOS might be used for complex, on-device analysis of voice recordings (if user consented) to provide richer emotional or tonal insights, which Alex then presents.

*   **Navigation (React Navigation):**
    *   "Growth" tab on main Bottom Tab Navigator leads to K (Personal Growth Dashboard).
    *   CB is the main view. CF and CG might be separate screens in a Stack Navigator initiated from K, or expandable sections within K.
    *   Links to specific session transcripts (Part 3.2 LA).

*   **Multimedia Aspects:**
    *   Interactive Charts (`react-native-svg-charts`). Color-coding (`StyleSheet`). Icons (`<Image>`). Alex's Avatar (`<Image>`/Lottie).

## 9.2. Screen: Achievement Badges & Progress (Mermaid: CC, K, CI)

*   **Mermaid Diagram ID:** K (Growth Dashboard), CC (Badges display section/screen), CI (Progress detail view for badges/skills).

*   **Purpose:** (Remains the same)
    *   Badge criteria and user progress data stored in Supabase, potentially managed by Nodely.

*   **Key UI Elements (within Growth Dashboard - K, using React Native components):**
    *   **View CC: Achievements / Badges Display (`<View>` section or separate screen in Stack):**
        *   "My Badges" Section (`<FlatList horizontal>` or grid of `<Image>` components for badges). Tapping a badge (`<TouchableOpacity>`) opens a Modal (Component 10.7) with description (`<Text>`).
        *   "Badges in Progress" / "Next Badges to Earn" Section (CI - `<View>`):
            *   `<FlatList>` of badges with progress bars (e.g., custom animated `<View>` or library). `<Text>` for percentage/criteria.
        *   "Recently Unlocked" (`<View>` highlighting new `<Image>` badges).
    *   **View CI: Skill Development Progress (Could be part of CC or separate screen):**
        *   `<FlatList>` of skills. Each item: Skill name (`<Text>`), progress bar (`<View>`), link (`<TouchableOpacity>`) to insights (9.1) or resources (9.3).
    *   Social Sharing (`<TouchableOpacity>` using `expo-sharing` API, strictly opt-in).

*   **Voice Agent Interactions (Alex - Component 10.2):** (Scripts remain largely the same, celebratory and encouraging)

*   **Navigation (React Navigation):**
    *   Section within Growth Dashboard (K) or a separate screen in its Stack.
    *   Tapping badges/skills links to details or other relevant sections (9.1, 9.3).
