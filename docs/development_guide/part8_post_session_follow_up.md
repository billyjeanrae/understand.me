# Part 8: Post-Session & Follow-Up

This part of the Development Guide covers the user experience after an "Understand-me" session has concluded. It includes AI-generated summaries, participant review and approval processes, digital sign-offs, session evaluations, and scheduling follow-up check-ins. Alex continues to guide users through these important post-session activities.

## 8.1. Screen: AI Generates Summary & Action Plan (Mermaid: BF)

*   **Mermaid Diagram ID:** BF (Represents the screen where the AI-generated session summary, key decisions, and action plan are presented).

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To provide all participants (or at least the Host) with a concise, AI-generated summary of the completed session.
    *   To clearly list key decisions made, agreements reached, and action items identified during Phase 4 (Resolve) and Phase 5 (Heal).
    *   To include references or links to specific multimedia files or transcript moments that were crucial to these outcomes.
    *   To serve as an initial draft that can then proceed to review and approval.

*   **Key UI Elements:**
    *   **Session Title, Date, and Participants List:** Clear identification of the session.
    *   **Overall Session Summary Section:**
        *   A brief narrative (2-3 paragraphs) generated by AI, summarizing the main topics discussed, the flow of the conversation (e.g., initial divergences, points of understanding, final resolutions), and the overall sentiment or outcome.
    *   **Key Decisions / Agreements Section:**
        *   Bulleted or numbered list of specific decisions or points of consensus reached (drawn from Phase 4 Agreement Tracker).
        *   e.g., "Agreement: Project Alpha's deadline will be extended by two weeks."
    *   **Action Plan Section:**
        *   Table or list format for action items:
            *   **Action Item:** (Description of the task).
            *   **Owner(s):** (Assigned participant(s)).
            *   **Due Date:** (If specified).
            *   **Status:** (e.g., "To Do" - will be updated later).
    *   **Referenced Multimedia / Transcript Highlights Section:**
        *   Links to specific multimedia files (from the Multimedia Context Panel) that were critical to a decision or action item.
        *   Direct quotes or links to key moments in the session transcript that support a listed agreement or provide essential context.
        *   e.g., "Reference: See 'Budget_Final.pdf' (shared by [User]) for details on the approved budget."
        *   e.g., "Transcript Highlight: [P1 Name]'s confirmation of taking on [Action Item X] at [Timestamp]."
    *   **"Download Summary (PDF)" Button.**
    *   **"Proceed to Review & Approve" Button (Host primary, may also be for participants if flow allows).**
    *   **"Edit Summary" Button (Primarily for Host, if direct edits are allowed before formal review).**
    *   **Disclaimer:** "This summary is AI-generated based on the session content. Please review carefully."

*   **Voice Agent Interactions (Alex):** Alex presents the summary and explains its components.
    *   **Screen Introduction:**
        *   **Alex:** "Our session '[Session Title]' has now concluded. Based on everything discussed and agreed upon, I've generated a summary including key decisions and an action plan. Please take a moment to review it."
    *   **Explaining Different Sections:**
        *   **Alex:** "You'll see an overall summary of our conversation, followed by specific agreements we reached, and then the action items we identified. I've also included links to important documents or transcript moments that relate to these points."
    *   **Highlighting Key Outcomes (Example):**
        *   **Alex:** "For instance, a key agreement was '[Quote a key agreement]', and the action item '[Quote an action item]' has been assigned to [Owner Name]."
    *   **Regarding AI Generation:**
        *   **Alex:** "Remember, this summary is automatically generated to capture the essence of our discussion. We'll have a chance to review and refine it in the next step to ensure it's perfectly accurate."
    *   **Guidance on Next Steps:**
        *   **Alex (To Host):** "Once you've had an initial look, you can proceed to the 'Review & Approve' stage where participants can also view and confirm the summary, or you can make some initial edits if you spot anything obvious."
        *   **Alex (To Participants, if they see this screen directly):** "Please review this summary. You'll soon have an opportunity to suggest any clarifications or confirm your agreement with it."

        *   **Comment Bubbles/Annotations:** Clicking on a paragraph or list item might allow users to add a comment or suggest an edit. These comments could be visible to the Host only, or to all participants, depending on settings.
        *   **Track Changes/Suggested Edits (Optional, advanced):** If direct editing is allowed for participants, changes might be shown with a "track changes" type of visibility for the Host to accept/reject. Simpler model: comments only.
    *   **Participant Review Status Section:**
        *   A list of participants invited to review.
        *   Status next to each name: "Not yet reviewed," "Reviewed - Comments added," "Approved," "Edits Suggested."
        *   This provides transparency on who still needs to review.
    *   **Action Buttons for Current Reviewer:**
        *   **"Approve Summary" Button:** Indicates the participant agrees with the summary as presented.
        *   **"Suggest Edits / Add Comments" Button:** Opens up commenting functionality or a text area for general comments if specific annotations aren't used.
        *   **"Request Clarification from Host" Button (Optional):** A way to send a message to the host if something is unclear before approving.
    *   **Deadline for Review (If set by Host):** "Please review and approve by [Date]."
    *   **Version History (Optional):** If the summary goes through multiple revisions, a way to see previous versions might be useful.

*   **Voice Agent Interactions (Alex):** Alex guides participants through the review process.
    *   **Screen Introduction (Participant View):**
        *   **Alex:** "Welcome to the session summary review for '[Session Title]'. The Host has shared the summary and action plan for everyone to look over. Please read through it carefully to ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and outcomes."
    *   **Explaining Review Process:**
        *   **Alex:** "As you review, if you see anything that needs a minor clarification or if you have a comment, you can add it directly to that section. [Explains how to use comment bubbles or suggestion mechanism]."
        *   **Alex:** "Once you're satisfied with the summary, please click 'Approve Summary'. If you have significant concerns, you might want to use the 'Suggest Edits' or 'Request Clarification' option first."
    *   **Guidance for Host (If Host is also on this screen, managing reviews):**
        *   **Alex:** "You can see the review status of all participants here. As comments or edit suggestions come in, you'll be able to review them and decide on incorporating them into a final version."
    *   **Encouraging Timely Review:**
        *   **Alex (If deadline is approaching):** "Just a reminder, the review period for this summary ends on [Date]. Please submit your feedback or approval when you get a chance."

        *   **Alex (After participant adds comment/suggestion):** "Your comments have been submitted to the Host for review. Thank you for your input!"

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Participants typically arrive here via a notification (email, in-app) after the Host initiates the review process (from Screen 8.1 or a dashboard).
    *   Host can access this screen from their dashboard to see review progress.
    *   "Approve Summary" might lead to Screen 8.3 ("Digital Sign-off") if that's the next step, or simply confirm their part is done.
    *   "Suggest Edits / Add Comments" keeps them on the screen or opens a commenting interface, after which they might still need to "Submit Comments for Host Review."

*   **Multimedia Aspects:**
    *   **Clear Document Presentation:** Easy-to-read formatting for the summary.
    *   **Visual Cues for Comments/Annotations:** Icons or highlighting to show where comments have been made.

    *   **Guidance for Same-Device Users (BJ):**
        *   **Alex:** "We'll go one by one for the sign-off on this device. First up is [Participant 1 Name]. [Participant 1 Name], please review the summary. If you agree, check the box, type your name, and then click 'Submit Signature & Next Participant'."
        *   **(When next participant is up):** "Thank you, [Participant 1 Name]. Now it's [Participant 2 Name]'s turn."
    *   **If "Decline to Sign" is chosen:**
        *   **Alex:** "You've indicated you do not wish to sign at this time. Please provide a brief reason for this, which will be recorded and shared with the Host. Declining to sign may have implications for the agreements reached; the Host will follow up on this."
    *   **Confirmation of Sign-off:**
        *   **Alex:** "Thank you, [Participant Name], your digital signature has been recorded."
        *   **Alex (Once all have signed):** "All participants have now signed off on the summary. This document is now finalized."

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Host or system initiates this step once the summary is finalized after Screen 8.2. Participants are notified.
    *   Remote users (BI) typically arrive via a notification link.
    *   Same-device users (BJ) are guided through this sequentially on the shared device, often as the last step if they are co-located post-session.
    *   After signing (or declining), users might be navigated to Screen 8.4 ("Session Evaluation & Feedback") or to their dashboard.
    *   If all signatures are collected, the Host is notified.

*   **Multimedia Aspects:**
    *   **Official Document Appearance:** The final summary should look clean and official.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   To gather feedback from participants about their experience in the session.
    *   To collect input on the effectiveness of the AI mediation, Alex's guidance, and the overall platform.
    *   To identify areas for improvement in the "Understand-me" platform and the AI mediation process.
    *   Feedback can be invaluable for refining both the technology and recommended facilitation practices.

*   **Key UI Elements:**
    *   **Headline:** "Session Feedback" or "How was your experience?"
    *   **Anonymity Assurance (Important):** "Your honest feedback is valuable and will be used to improve 'Understand-me'. Individual responses related to the platform and AI will be anonymized before review. Feedback about the session content itself may be shared with the Host if you choose."
    *   **Rating Scales (e.g., 1-5 stars, Likert scales):**
        *   "Overall, how satisfied were you with this session?"
        *   "How clear were the session goals?"
        *   "How fair and balanced did you find the discussion?"
        *   "How helpful was Alex, the AI voice agent, in guiding the session?"
        *   "How would you rate the accuracy of the live transcription?"
    *   **Open-Ended Questions (Text Areas):**
        *   "What worked well in this session?"
        *   "What could have been improved in this session?"
        *   "Do you have any specific feedback about Alex's role or the AI features used?"
        *   "Would you recommend 'Understand-me' to others based on this session?" (with a "Why/Why not?" follow-up).
    *   **Optional: Feedback Sharing Preference:**
        *   Checkbox: "Share my feedback about the session (e.g., what worked well, what could be improved) anonymously with the Host." (If unchecked, feedback on session content is for platform improvement only). Feedback on Alex/AI is typically always anonymized for platform improvement.
    *   **"Submit Feedback" Button.**
    *   **"Skip / No Feedback" Button (less prominent).**

*   **Voice Agent Interactions (Alex):** Alex encourages feedback and reassures users about anonymity.

    *   **Encouraging Honest Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "Please be candid. We want to know what worked well for you and what could be better. Your feedback on AI performance and platform usability is particularly helpful and will be reviewed anonymously."
    *   **Explaining Anonymity & Sharing:**
        *   **Alex:** "When you provide ratings or comments about the platform or my role as Alex, these are grouped and anonymized before our development team sees them. If you choose to share feedback about the session content itself, you can decide if that's shared with the Host, also anonymously."
    *   **Guiding Through Questions (If user seems idle):**
        *   **Alex:** "Take your time to answer. For example, think about whether the session felt productive, or if there were any technical issues. Any detail is helpful."
    *   **After Submission:**
        *   **Alex:** "Thank you for your valuable feedback! We'll use it to make 'Understand-me' even better."

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Typically appears after Screen 8.3 ("Digital Sign-off") or as the immediate next step after a session ends if sign-off is not required for that session type.
    *   Can also be accessed via a notification link sent after the session.
    *   "Submit Feedback" confirms submission and usually navigates to the user's dashboard or a generic "thank you" / "session ended" page.
    *   "Skip" also navigates away from this flow.

*   **Multimedia Aspects:**
    *   **Rating Scale UI:** Clear and intuitive star ratings, sliders, or radio buttons.
    *   **Text Areas:** Well-sized for open-ended comments.
    *   **Alex's Avatar:** Present in a supportive, non-judgmental way.
    *   **Visual separation** between questions about the session itself and questions about the platform/AI.
