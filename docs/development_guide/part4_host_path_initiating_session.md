# Part 4: Host Path - Initiating a Session

This part of the Development Guide details the journey a Host takes to initiate a new session. It covers the steps from describing the initial situation or conflict to configuring the session and inviting participants, with a focus on leveraging AI insights and Alex's guidance. While "Describe Conflict" is used as a specific starting point, this path can be adapted for various session types where initial context is important.

## 4.1. Screen: Describe Conflict (Mermaid: O)

*   **Mermaid Diagram ID:** O (Represents the initial screen where a host describes the context, problem, or conflict for an upcoming session).

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Allow the Host to provide a detailed description of the situation, conflict, or topic to be addressed in the session.
    *   Enable the upload of relevant multimedia files (documents, images, audio snippets, short video clips) that provide context.
    *   Guide the Host to articulate the core issues clearly, which will inform AI analysis and session setup.
    *   Set the stage for a focused and productive session.

*   **Key UI Elements:**
    *   **Session Title Field:** A clear field for giving the session a working title (e.g., "Project Alpha - Budget Discrepancy," "Team Communication Challenges").
    *   **Main Description Text Area:** A large, resizable text area for the Host to type out the details of the conflict or situation.
        *   Placeholder text: e.g., "Describe the situation, the key parties involved, the main points of contention, and any desired outcomes..."
    *   **Multimedia Upload Section:**
        *   Drag-and-drop area and/or "Upload Files" button.
        *   Supported file types clearly listed (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .docx, .jpg, .png, .mp3, .wav, .mp4 - with size limits).
        *   Display of uploaded files with options to remove or rename.
        *   Progress bars for uploads.

    *   **Screen Introduction:**
        *   **Cue:** Host lands on this screen.
        *   **Alex:** "Starting a new session is a great first step. On this screen, you can describe the situation or topic you'd like to address. The more detail you provide, the better I can help analyze it and suggest a productive session setup. What would you like to call this session?"
    *   **Guidance During Description:**
        *   **Cue:** Host is typing in the main description area.
        *   **Alex (Subtle prompt if Host pauses for long):** "Remember to include who is involved, what the core issues are, and any specific incidents or examples. No need to be perfect, just get your initial thoughts down."
        *   **Alex (If specific keywords related to high emotion are typed, e.g., "furious," "very upset"):** "It sounds like this is a challenging situation. Take your time to describe it. Acknowledging the emotions involved can be helpful."
    *   **Encouraging Multimedia Uploads:**
        *   **Cue:** Host has written a description but not uploaded files.
        *   **Alex:** "You've provided a good description. Do you have any documents, emails, screenshots, or even short audio clips that might give more context? Uploading them can help us get a fuller picture."
    *   **Explaining File Usage & AI Analysis:**
        *   **Cue:** Host uploads a file.
        *   **Alex:** "Thanks for uploading '[filename]'. Our AI will analyze its content to help identify key themes, sentiments, and talking points. This stays confidential and is only used to prepare for your session."
