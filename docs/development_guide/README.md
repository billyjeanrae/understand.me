# Understand.me - Development Guide

This document serves as the comprehensive guide for developing the "Understand.me" AI-mediated conflict resolution platform. It outlines the unified architecture, development workflows, and implementation patterns for the 5-phase mediation system with Udine voice agent.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Documents

- **[Unified Architecture Specification](../unified_architecture_specification.md)** - Definitive tech stack and structure
- **[bolt.new Development Rules](../bolt-development-rules.md)** - Development workflows and best practices
- **[Boilerplate Setup Guide](boilerplate_setup_guide.md)** - Complete setup instructions

## üîß Integration Guides

- **[LangChain 5-Phase Mediation Workflow](../integration_guides/langchain_mediation_workflow.md)** - AI orchestration implementation
- **[Hume AI Emotional Intelligence](../integration_guides/hume_ai_emotional_intelligence.md)** - Real-time emotion analysis

## üì± UI Development Guide

### ‚úÖ Current Documentation (Updated for Unified Architecture)

1. **[Part 1: Global Design & Interaction Principles](part1_global_design.md)**
   - ‚úÖ Updated for Udine voice agent
   - ‚úÖ Unified technology stack
   - ‚úÖ 5-phase mediation workflow principles

### üöß Future UI Documentation (To Be Created)

The following UI documentation will be created based on the unified architecture:

- **Part 2: Initial User Experience & Onboarding** - AI-powered onboarding with Udine
- **Part 3: Main Dashboard & Core Navigation** - 5-phase workflow navigation
- **Part 4: Host Path - Initiating a Session** - LangChain conflict analysis integration
- **Part 5: Participant Path - Joining a Session** - Emotional intelligence onboarding
- **Part 6: Pre-Session Preparation** - LangGraph workflow preparation
- **Part 7: AI-Mediated Session Interface** - 5-phase mediation with Udine
- **Part 8: Post-Session & Follow-Up** - Action items and healing phase
- **Part 9: Growth & Tracking Module** - Emotional intelligence insights
- **Part 10: Shared Components & UI Patterns** - Udine and emotion components

## üìã Validation & Testing

- **[Documentation Validation Checklist](../documentation_validation_checklist.md)** - Consistency verification
