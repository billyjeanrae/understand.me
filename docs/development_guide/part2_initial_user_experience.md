        *   **User Options (Buttons or typed):** "Sure, let's do it!", "Maybe later."
    *   **Questioning Style:**
        *   Alex asks open-ended or multiple-choice questions one at a time.
        *   The tone is friendly, empathetic, and patient (as defined in Part 1.4).
        *   Questions are designed to feel natural and not overly intrusive.
    *   **Example Questions & Scripts (Illustrative):**
        *   **Alex:** "Great! First off, when you're in a meeting or workshop, what's most important for you to get out of it? For example, are you focused on clear decisions, making sure everyone's voice is heard, or perhaps learning new things?"
            *   *(User provides free-text or selects from options like "Clear Decisions", "Inclusivity", "Learning", "Other")*
        *   **Alex (If user selected "Inclusivity"):** "That's a great focus! 'Understand-me' can definitely help with that. Do you often find yourself in situations where language differences or fast-paced discussions are a challenge?"
            *   *(User responds)*
        *   **Alex:** "Thanks for sharing. Now, thinking about how you prefer to receive information – do you like quick summaries, or do you prefer all the details?"
            *   *(User chooses "Summaries" or "Details")*
        *   **Alex (If user indicated they might be a "Host" during sign-up or based on previous answers):** "If you're hosting a session, are there any specific terms, jargon, or project names you use frequently? Knowing this can help me improve transcription accuracy for you."
            *   *(User can list terms or skip)*
        *   **Alex:** "And for fun, if you were a communication superhero, what would your superpower be? Maybe 'Super-Speed Listening,' 'Crystal Clear Speaking,' or 'Ultimate Empathy Powers'?" (This question aims to be lighthearted and gauge personality).
            *   *(User responds)*
    *   **Feedback & Encouragement:**
        *   **Alex:** "Got it!", "That's helpful, thanks!", "Interesting!" - Short affirmations after user responses.
    *   **Handling Clarifications:**
        *   **User:** "What do you mean by 'communication style'?"
        *   **Alex:** "Good question! I mean things like whether you prefer formal or informal language, if you like a lot of detail or just the key points, or even how quickly you like conversations to move."
    *   **Conclusion:**
        *   **Alex:** "That's everything for now! Thanks so much for sharing that with me, [User's Name]. This will really help me and 'Understand-me' support you better. You can always update these preferences in your settings later on."
        *   **Alex:** "Next, I can give you a quick interactive tour of the platform, or you can jump right in. What would you prefer?"
        *   **User Options (Buttons):** "Take the Tour," "Explore on My Own."

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Arrives after successful Sign-Up (or first login if skipped previously).

    *   **Initiation (If user chose "Take the Tour" from Personality Assessment or if it's the first login):**

        *   **Alex:** "Great! For now, let's imagine you've started a session. (Transition to a simulated session view). Here's what your main session screen looks like. You can see the live transcription area here (highlights it). During a real session, words will appear as they're spoken."
        *   **Alex (Highlighting a Q&A panel):** "If you want to ask a question without interrupting, you can use the Q&A panel. Try typing a sample question now."
            *   *(User types a question. Alex might show a mock response or acknowledgment.)*
        *   **Alex:** "Excellent! Participants can also use this to send questions to the host. Now, let's look at how you can enable translation if you have multilingual participants..." (Guides user to a simplified language selection menu).
        *   **Alex (Highlighting where recordings are saved):** "After your sessions, you can find recordings and transcripts here. (Highlights navigation to 'Recordings')."
    *   **Encouragement & Feedback:**
        *   **Alex:** "Perfect!", "Well done!", "Exactly!" - When user completes a task.
        *   **Alex (If user struggles or makes a mistake):** "No worries! Try clicking on [correct element description] instead." or "Almost! Let me show you again." (Potentially using a visual cue like a pulsing highlight).
    *   **Offering More Information:**
        *   **Alex:** "This is just a quick overview. You can find more detailed guides in our Help Center anytime." (Highlights Help icon/link).
    *   **Concluding the Tutorial:**
        *   **Alex:** "And that's the basics! You've done a great job. You're now ready to start your first real session or explore more on your own. Remember, I'm here if you have questions. Just look for my icon."
        *   **User Options:** "Go to Dashboard," "Explore Features."

    *   Progresses step-by-step, guided by Alex and on-screen prompts.
    *   Users can often "Go Back" to a previous step or "Next" to continue.
    *   "Exit Tutorial" should ideally take the user to their main dashboard.
    *   Upon completion, navigates to the main dashboard or a relevant starting point within the application.

*   **Multimedia Aspects:**
    *   **Screen Overlays & Highlights:** Dynamic visual cues (e.g., spotlights, arrows, temporary borders) to focus attention on specific UI elements being explained.
    *   **Short Animated Explanations (Optional):** For complex interactions, a very short (5-10 second) animation could demonstrate the action before the user tries it.
    *   **Alex's Avatar:** Present, possibly in a corner of the screen or integrated into the tutorial prompts, providing a friendly face to the guidance.
    *   **Simulated Content:** If a sandbox environment is used, this will involve displaying mock data (text, user icons, etc.) that looks realistic.
