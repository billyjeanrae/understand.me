## Logged Decisions

---
**Decision ID:** `20231027-001`
**Date:** `2023-10-27` (Conceptual date, based on project documentation phase)
**Decision Made:**
Adoption of the primary technology stack: Expo (React Native with TypeScript) for the mobile frontend; Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions) as the Backend as a Service (BaaS); PicaOS as the AI orchestrator; Google GenAI SDK for core LLM and AI capabilities; ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis; Dappier for potential real-time data feeds and RAG; Nodely for potential IPFS integration and workflows; Upstash Redis for caching; and Sentry for monitoring.

**Rationale:**
*   **Expo (React Native, TypeScript):** Chosen for its cross-platform mobile development capabilities, allowing for a single codebase for iOS and Android, rapid development with a rich ecosystem of libraries, and strong typing with TypeScript for better code quality and maintainability. Aligns with the requirement for a mobile-first application.
*   **Supabase:** Selected for its comprehensive BaaS offerings, providing a managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, file storage, real-time capabilities, and serverless edge functions, all under a serverless-first philosophy. This significantly reduces backend development and management overhead.
*   **PicaOS (Conceptual AI Orchestrator):** Introduced to manage and simplify the complex interactions between the frontend and multiple AI/ML services, as well as other specialized backend services. It allows for dynamic prompt engineering, context management, and a clean API for the Expo app.
*   **Google GenAI SDK:** Chosen for its powerful and versatile LLM capabilities (e.g., Gemini models) for text analysis, summarization, insight generation, STT, and vision tasks, which are core to "Understand.me's" AI features.
*   **ElevenLabs API:** Selected for its high-quality, natural-sounding voice synthesis, crucial for the persona of "Alex," the AI mediator.
*   **Dappier (Conceptual):** Included for its potential to provide specialized real-time data feeds and to facilitate advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases, enhancing the contextual awareness of the AI.
*   **Nodely (Conceptual):** Chosen for its potential to integrate with IPFS for decentralized, immutable storage of critical records (e.g., signed summaries) and for orchestrating complex backend workflows.
*   **Upstash Redis:** Selected as a serverless caching solution to improve performance, reduce latency, and decrease load on Supabase and expensive AI API calls by caching frequently accessed data and computation results.
*   **Sentry:** Chosen as a comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring tool, essential for maintaining application health across the client and backend services.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   Native iOS/Android development (Swift/Kotlin): Higher development effort for cross-platform.
*   Other BaaS providers (e.g., Firebase): Supabase chosen for its PostgreSQL core and open-source nature.
*   Building a monolithic backend: Contrasts with the serverless-first philosophy and scalability goals.
*   Alternative AI/TTS services: Google GenAI and ElevenLabs selected based on perceived quality, features, and scalability for core needs.

**Stakeholders Involved (if applicable):** Project Lead, Technical Architect.
**Potential Consequences / Trade-offs / Future Considerations:**
*   Reliance on several managed/external services requires careful monitoring of costs, API limits, and potential vendor lock-in for some components.
*   The conceptual nature of PicaOS, Dappier, and Nodely means their specific implementation details and any associated complexities will need to be carefully managed during development.
*   Inter-service communication latency needs to be monitored and optimized.

**Decision ID:** `20231027-002`
**Date:** `2023-10-27` (Conceptual date)
**Decision Made:**
Adoption of a Serverless-First Architecture philosophy for the "Understand.me" application.

**Rationale:**
*   **Scalability:** Serverless components (Supabase, Edge Functions, PicaOS if deployed serverlessly, Upstash Redis, Google GenAI, ElevenLabs) can scale automatically with demand, reducing the need for manual infrastructure provisioning.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead:** Offloads server management, patching, and maintenance to cloud providers and managed service vendors.
*   **Pay-Per-Use Cost Model:** Aligns costs more directly with actual usage, potentially offering better cost-efficiency, especially for applications with variable load.
*   **Focus on Application Logic:** Allows the development team to concentrate on building core "Understand.me" features rather than managing infrastructure.
*   **Faster Iteration:** Enables quicker deployment of new features and updates.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   Traditional monolithic server application: Higher operational burden, potentially slower scaling.
*   Microservices on self-managed Kubernetes: More complex infrastructure management, though offers fine-grained control.

**Stakeholders Involved (if applicable):** Project Lead, Technical Architect.
**Potential Consequences / Trade-offs / Future Considerations:**
*   Potential for "cold starts" with serverless functions, though this can be mitigated.
*   Debugging across distributed serverless components can be more complex (Sentry and good logging are crucial).
*   Vendor lock-in with specific serverless providers for certain functionalities.
*   Cost management requires careful monitoring of usage across multiple services.

**Decision ID:** `20231027-003`
**Date:** `2023-10-27` (Conceptual date)
**Decision Made:**
PicaOS will be implemented as the central AI Orchestration layer.

**Rationale:**
*   **Complexity Abstraction:** The "Understand.me" app relies on multiple AI services (Google GenAI for LLM, STT, Vision; ElevenLabs for TTS) and potentially data from Dappier for RAG. PicaOS provides a single, unified interface for the Expo app to request complex AI-driven actions, abstracting the underlying multi-step calls and data transformations.
*   **Context Management:** PicaOS is designed to maintain the state and context of AI interactions (e.g., session phase, user profiles, recent conversation turns), which is crucial for relevant and coherent AI responses.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Engineering:** PicaOS can dynamically construct and adapt prompts for Google GenAI based on the evolving context, improving the quality and relevance of AI outputs.
*   **Simplified Client Logic:** Reduces the burden on the Expo app, keeping it focused on UI/UX rather than complex AI workflow management.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows for easier swapping or addition of AI services in the backend via PicaOS without necessarily impacting the client application's API contract with PicaOS.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   Direct calls from Expo app to each AI service: Would significantly increase client-side complexity, make context management difficult, and expose multiple service credentials/logics to the client.
*   Implementing all orchestration logic purely in Supabase Edge Functions: While possible for some flows, PicaOS is conceptualized as a more specialized layer that might have its own state management or deployment characteristics optimized for complex AI orchestrations beyond simple function chaining.

**Stakeholders Involved (if applicable):** Project Lead, Technical Architect, AI/ML Lead.
**Potential Consequences / Trade-offs / Future Considerations:**
*   PicaOS itself becomes a critical component; its reliability and scalability must be ensured (whether it's built as a collection of serverless functions or a scalable service).
*   The API contract between the Expo app and PicaOS needs to be well-defined and versioned.
*   Latency of PicaOS orchestrations needs careful monitoring and optimization.

**Decision ID:** `20231027-004`
**Date:** `2023-10-27` (Conceptual date)
**Decision Made:**
Upstash Redis will be used as the primary caching layer for backend services.

**Rationale:**
*   **Performance Improvement:** To reduce latency for frequently accessed data from Supabase (e.g., user profiles, session templates) and for computationally expensive AI-generated results from PicaOS/Google GenAI (e.g., document summaries, common Alex responses).
*   **Load Reduction:** To decrease the number of direct queries to Supabase PostgreSQL and API calls to Google GenAI/ElevenLabs, potentially reducing costs and improving the stability of these primary services under load.
*   **Serverless Nature:** Upstash Redis is a serverless offering, aligning with the overall architecture philosophy and reducing management overhead.
*   **Ease of Integration:** Good client libraries available for Node.js/Deno environments used by Supabase Edge Functions and potentially PicaOS.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   No caching: Would lead to higher latencies and costs for frequently accessed data or repeated AI computations.
*   Supabase built-in caching (PostgreSQL level): While PostgreSQL has its own caching, Upstash Redis provides a dedicated, high-performance, distributed caching layer that can be more flexibly controlled by application logic in PicaOS/Edge Functions.
*   Other Redis providers: Upstash chosen for its serverless model and ease of use.

**Stakeholders Involved (if applicable):** Technical Architect, Backend Lead.
**Potential Consequences / Trade-offs / Future Considerations:**
*   **Cache Invalidation Complexity:** Requires careful design of cache keys and invalidation strategies (TTL-based, event-driven) to ensure data consistency. Stale cache data can lead to issues.
*   **Increased Infrastructure Component:** Adds another service to manage and monitor, though Upstash is serverless.
*   Cost of Upstash Redis, though likely offset by savings on other service calls and database load.

**Decision ID:** `20231027-005`
**Date:** `2023-10-27` (Conceptual date)
**Decision Made:**
Nodely will be integrated for optional IPFS storage for specific data artifacts requiring decentralized persistence and content addressing.

**Rationale:**
*   **Immutability & Verifiability:** For certain data like digitally signed session summaries or critical evidence files shared during a session, IPFS (via Nodely) provides a way to store them with content-based addressing, offering a degree of immutability and verifiability.
*   **Decentralized Persistence:** Reduces reliance on a single storage provider (Supabase Storage) for these specific, critical artifacts if long-term, decentralized availability is a goal.
*   **Content Addressing:** Using CIDs for these files can be beneficial for unique identification and retrieval.
*   **Nodely as Abstraction:** Nodely simplifies the interaction with IPFS, managing pinning services and providing a more straightforward API for the backend (PicaOS or Supabase Edge Functions) to use.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   Storing all files only in Supabase Storage: Simpler, but lacks the specific benefits of IPFS for certain types of records where immutability or decentralized verifiability is desired.
*   Direct IPFS integration without Nodely: More complex to manage pinning services and IPFS node interactions directly from backend logic.

**Stakeholders Involved (if applicable):** Technical Architect, Product Owner (for identifying data requiring IPFS).
**Potential Consequences / Trade-offs / Future Considerations:**
*   **Complexity:** Adds complexity to the file storage and retrieval workflow.
*   **Cost:** IPFS pinning services (managed by or through Nodely) will have associated costs.
*   **Data Privacy:** Files on public IPFS are publicly accessible by their CID. Therefore, only non-sensitive data or data that has been client-side encrypted (with robust key management) should be stored this way. For "Understand.me," this means it's likely for finalized, agreed-upon documents rather than raw user inputs.
*   Retrieval speed from IPFS can vary compared to centralized storage like Supabase Storage; use primarily for archival or when decentralized properties are key.
